## libpalliate 

This page contains documentation regarding libpalliate, palliate's core library that is supposed to be included in all plugins too.

Everything in subfolders `Classes`, `Examples` and `Namespaces` is automatically generated using [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) and converted to Markdown using [Doxybook2](https://github.com/matusnovak/doxybook2) and some [custom templates](https://github.com/palliate/libpalliate/tree/master/docs/templates) to match just-the-docs' YAML front matter. All generated documents have `/generated/` in the URL.
