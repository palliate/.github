This project aims to seamlessly integrate natively rendered Windows applications into a Linux desktop system. It does not matter if the Windows system is running in a VM or on a physically different machine as long as Windows has its own GPU.

It is roughly comparable to RDP RemoteApp or single-application VNC, although this project's focus is on providing very low latency transmission of frames while preserving window management metadata.


palliate is still in early stages of development. Check back later :)
